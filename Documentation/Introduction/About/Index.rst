What does it do?
----------------

This extension provides a simple and uniform page type for
categorising and structuring academic study pages within TYPO3.

The focus here is on the academic environment, i.e. universities, colleges and
universities of applied sciences, to enable them to maintain, display and filter
their study programmes easily and quickly by means of categorisation and typing.

A pre-selection of typed categories is provided, which allows a quick and easy
structuring according to the main characteristics of a study programme.
