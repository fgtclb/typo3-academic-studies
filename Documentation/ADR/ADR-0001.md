# Study Programme Page: Usage of own data types instead of sys_categories

## Status

pending

## Context and Problem Statement

According to Use cases a TYPO3 extension has to be programmed, which defines
a new Doktype for TYPO3 pages and adds requirements to a study programme
for use in Universities (of Applied Sciences) for structuring and outputting
information about study programmes with structured data.

## Referenced Use Cases / Tasks

- [Study Page Detail HAW](https://pm.web-vision.de/browse/HAW-295)
- [Study page Detail HNEE](https://pm.web-vision.de/browse/HNEE-140)

## Decision Drivers

- Markus Hofmann
- Riad Trumic
- Mark Houben

## Considered Options

For the usage of the structured data are two possibilities:

* Usage of sys_category
* Usage of own dataset

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "**Usage of sys_category**".

Despite the disadvantages that sys_category brings with it in terms of
expandability, the first stage of expansion will focus on sys_category as
structured data.

After clarifying some issues, the following solution will be implemented by the
development team:
Extension of sys_category by a field Type: By means of this type, the categories
are typed in order to facilitate database queries without tree bubbling. By
means of this typing, the categories are structured analogously to the
acceptance criteria in order to enable a simplified assignment of individual
attributes (categories).

The development team points out that an extension, in whatever form, with system
categories is not planned. If this is desired by a customer, to bind further
information apart from the attribute and the typification to this data record,
a separate data record is necessary for this, which must be considered
separately. A possible solution to this issue would be to define a folder wit
h its own content elements, in which the content element can then be assigned
to the individual category in order to enable further information such as images
or notes. However, this is to be understood as a hint and is not part of this
Architecture Decision Record.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Usage of sys_category

#### Pros

* core included
* system wide

#### Cons

* system wide
  * Usage only for a small part
  * categories shown everywhere
* not really extendable
  * feature fields go to all categories, if needed or not
  * generates core dependency
  * Possible storage overload
* Duplicates in record allowed by design

### Usage of own dataset

#### Pros

* More flexibility
* Better extensibility
  * Images
  * Descriptions
  * Notices
* Avoids duplicated entry select by design (e.g. regular study time can only
  get one item)
* Fine granular rights management
  * CRUD rights and read rights can be divided
  * Access to fields per user/-group
* Better and faster output
  * one table defines one set of attributes to study programme
  * No bubbling in tree -> faster rendering
  * Search handling improvement

#### Cons

* more investigation at start
* Maintenance
  * Support of TYPO3 versions
  * Bugfixing
